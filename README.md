# Jinder - Job Matching Web Application

## Project Overview

Inspired by Tinder, Jinder is a web application that enables jobseekers to browse through job openings and apply by thumbing up, or reject through thumbing down. Thumbing up automatically sends the jobseekerâ€™s CV and cover letter to the company. Companies can view and evaluate applications to quickly find and connect with the most suitable candidates.

## Features

- **Jobseeker Registration/Login**: Users register as jobseekers, allowing them to apply for job openings.
- **Company Registration/Login**: Companies can post jobs and review applications after signing up.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed for authentication to ensure user and company data protection.
- **Application Evaluation**: Companies can review and take decisive actions to either approve or reject candidates.
- **Swipe Interaction**: Jobseekers browse through job openings, reacting with a thumbs up or thumbs down.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: MySQL

## Getting Started

This documentation will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure to have the following installed:

- MySQL Workbench (or any MySQL-compatible database)
- Python (Version 3.x)
- VS Code (or another IDE)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository using the following command or download the ZIP file from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MabelleAttieh/Jinder.git
    ```

2. Set up the backend in VS Code:

   - Open the backend project (`app.py`) in VS Code.
   - Install the required Python libraries by typing the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install flask flask-cors mysql-connector-python bcrypt
    ```

3. Set up the database:

   - Create a new database in MySQL Workbench named `Jinder`.
   - Update your database connection credentials in the backend project (`app.py`):

    ```python
    MYSQL_HOST = 'localhost'
    MYSQL_USER = 'your_username'
    MYSQL_PASSWORD = 'your_password'
    MYSQL_DB = 'JINDER'
    ```

   Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your MySQL username and password.

4. Run the backend server in VS Code:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Run the frontend:

   - In the frontend folder, double-click on `index.html`, and the website will automatically open in your browser.
